                  In a recent interview with The Australian, Gurner revealed
                  that more than half his tax income for 2018 came from
                  investing in one Bitcoin system - a somewhat sneaky
                  investment, but one that's made him millions, and hundreds of
                  Australian families thousands each month.

                  the solution people have been waiting for” said Gurner. After
                  ‘experimenting’ with multiple Cryptocurrencies; he explained:
                  “I think Bitcoin is better than currency. Never in history
                  have we had an opportunity that people can easily take
                  advantage of to generate tremendous wealth in such a short
                  period of time!" -

                  In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Gurner said how he came
                  across the opportunity which is available to everyone right

                  <b>Gurner says:</b> “It’s a controversial investment, because
                  the world banking community does not want the average worker
                  to have access to this much wealth outside of the system.

                  popularity and the results are astonishing. Gurner explains
                  how “timing is key with an investment like this and sadly the
                  window for this is this is so narrow; many Australian workers
                  will miss out. There really is just a few months or even weeks
                  left to benefit."

                  Tim Gurner and Bec Pottinger from Grenfell NSW, initially
                  thought too. Tim Gurner was a 34-year-old customer store
                  manager until he lost his job in October 2018. He was lucky
                  enough to be invited to beta test the program in January this
                  year after stumbling across an advert on Facebook.

                  Making money from home is only a dream. But I decided to try

                  afterwards. It was almost fun learning something new. Money
                  was flowing into my account, I didn't believe it was real. I
                  was so skeptical that I'd even receive the money that I didn't
